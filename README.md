# TidyTuesday_BeachVolleyball
This is the repository of my work based on the Tidy Tuesday Beach Volleyball Data Set. I have tried to create some creative graphs on the data set. Hope you will like them too. 
The data set can be accessed from the Git Hub Link - https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-05-19/readme.md 

The R Plots prepared in this repository are:- 

1. Winning/Loosing Strategies as a graph which can indicate the predictors of wins/lossed as against the moves made in the games by the winning or the loosing teams
2. Frequency Distributions of Wins after a 1st Set loss versus the difference in the rankings between the two teams
3. Age Distribution of players in the winning and the loosing teams. If age can be thought of as a predictor for a win. Violin maps are added as a learning demo.
4. Height distribution of the players in the winning and the loosing teamsn. If height can be thought of as a predictor for a win. Violin maps are added as a learning demo.
5. Moves and Strategies adopted in the different rounds. This graph shows how the competitions tend to become more and more competitive as the tournament progresses through Rounds
6. The duration of the matches as against the rounds. The outliers indicate how certain matches tend to get lengthy as we get to more tougher phases of the tournament.
